**⚡ Enhanced Text Object Searching**
```csharp
public void FindAllTextObjects()
{
    _isSearching = true;

    // Code to find text objects, including inactive ones
    _textObjects = _service.FindTextObjects(IncludeInactive, ShowLegacyText, ShowTMP, ShowTMPUI).ToList();
    
    _isSearching = false; 
}
```
Search support for active and inactive text objects.
Optimized for performance and memory usage with caching strategies.
Easily extensible for future text object types.
___
**🧩 Flexible Filtering Options

Intuitive UI controls for filtering text objects:
```csharp
**Object type (Legacy UI Text, TextMeshPro, TextMeshProUGUI)**
**Active/inactive status**
**Name or content search**
(Recommendation: Utilize filters for quicker object location in large scenes)
```
___
**🌟 Clean Architecture with MVC Pattern

Model-View-Controller (MVC): This utility follows the MVC pattern to separate concerns:
Model: Contains data representation (TextObjectInfo, TextObjectType).
View: Manages user interface rendering (TextFinderView).
Controller: Coordinates user input and application logic (TextFinderPresenter).
SOLID Principles:
Single Responsibility: Each class has a distinct responsibility.
Open/Closed: New text finders can be added without modifying existing code.
Liskov Substitution: All finder classes implement the same interface.
Interface Segregation: Interfaces are kept lean for specific functionalities.
Dependency Injection: Services are injected to promote testability.
___
**📊 Performance and Scalability

Efficiently handles large numbers of text objects.
Search Performance:
Optimized algorithms for filtering and searching through text objects.
Capable of handling scenes with thousands of text objects within milliseconds.
Memory Efficiency:
Utilizes caching strategies to minimize duplicate calculations and reduce memory footprint.
___
